Arizona State University
_Supervised_ by Dr. Yu Zhang


## Summary:
1. Collaborated with a PhD student in Cooperative Robotic Systems (CRS) Lab led by Dr. Yu Zhang
2. Studied the concept and technicality of human-robot interaction, robot task planning (PDDL, fast forward, etc.), augmented reality (AR), virtual shadow rendering, and 
intention signaling 
3. Examined the deployed applications to HoloLens through Visual Studio for generating virtual shadow within mixed reality 
4. Explored the robot simulations (Kinova, Jaco, Jackal UGV, etc.) and applications (Tower of Hanoi, etc.) by using Gazebo and ROS for software development


## Specific Areas:
- Human-Robot Teaming
- Planning
- PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)
- Augmented Reality (AR)


**Virtual shadow projection** (control) for intention signaling to explain to humans in the visual sense
<br /> **Intention signaling** at the time when applicable and with what is necessary
